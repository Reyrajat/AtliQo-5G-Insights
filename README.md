## 📈 Key Insights

📉 Revenue declined slightly by 0.5% after the 5G launch (₹1597.7 Cr → ₹1589.7 Cr), showing stagnation despite overall market growth. The decline was most evident in Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and Chandigarh.

📊 ARPU increased by 8.5% (₹189.4 → ₹205.5), but active users fell by 8.3% (843.5L → 773.7L), indicating that pricing increases drove short-term revenue but triggered user churn.

🚨 Unsubscribed users surged by 23.5%, confirming growing customer dissatisfaction post-5G rollout and signaling the need for retention campaigns.

⭐ Mumbai, Kolkata, and Gurgaon maintained steady revenue growth and continue to be AtliQo’s strongest-performing cities.

💰 Top-performing plans — P1, P2, P3, P4, and P11 — together contribute over 60% of total plan revenue, with P11 (a new 5G plan) showing exceptional adoption and growth potential.

📉 Market share declined from 20.2% to 18.9% post-5G, while PIO and Britel gained ground, suggesting a competitive pricing or service positioning gap.
